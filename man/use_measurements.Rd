\title{Add measurement data for an individual or event to a \code{tibble}}
\usage{
use_measurements(.df, cols = NULL, type = NULL, unit = NULL, .keep = "unused")
}
\arguments{
\item{.df}{a \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} that the column should be appended to.}

\item{.keep}{Control which columns from .data are retained in the output.
Note that unlike \code{dplyr::mutate}, which defaults to \code{"all"} this defaults to
\code{"unused"}; i.e. only keeps Darwin Core fields, and not those fields used to
generate them.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the requested fields added.
