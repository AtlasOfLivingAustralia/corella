## Overview

`corella` is an R package that helps users standardize their data using the 
[*Darwin Core*](https://dwc.tdwg.org) data standard, used for biodiversity data like species occurrences. `corella` provides tools to prepare, manipulate and validate data against the standard's criteria. Once standardized, data can be subsequently shared as a [*Darwin Core Archive*](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/dwca-guide#what-is-darwin-core-archive-dwc-a) and published to open data infrastructures like the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/). 

`corella` was
built, and is maintained, by the [Science & Decision Support
Team](https://labs.ala.org.au) at the [Atlas of Living
Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) (ALA). The package is named for an endangered Australian species of [alpine frog](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/cbf9278d-64b7-43d6-9691-78b99b2eb65f#overview) native to the marshlands and forests of ACT and NSW.
