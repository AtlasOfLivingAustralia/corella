## Resubmission

## Resubmission

This is a second resubmission (v0.1.2 -> v0.1.3) to fix a bug that appeared 
when building the documentation with pkgdown using GH Actions. 

* The function `set_measurements()` 
was causing a CPU limit error to trigger, and the website build process would 
fail (this bug wasn't appearing locally so it was missed). We fixed the issue 
and have subsequently increased the version number as a patch.
