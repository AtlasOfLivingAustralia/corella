Description: `corella` is an R package that helps users standardize their data 
using the "Darwin Core" data standard, used for biodiversity data like species 
occurrences. `corella` provides tools to prepare, manipulate and 
validate data against the standard’s criteria. Once standardized, data can be 
subsequently shared as a ‘Darwin Core Archive’ and published to open data 
infrastructures like the Atlas of Living Australia and GBIF.
