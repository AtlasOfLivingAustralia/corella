Description: Helps users standardise data to the Darwin Core Standard, a global 
             data standard to store, document, and share biodiversity data like 
             species occurrence records. The package provides tools to 
             manipulate data to conform with, and check validity against, the 
             Darwin Core Standard. Using corella allows users to verify that 
             their data can be used to build 'Darwin Core Archives' using the 
             galaxias package.
